    <p>this is dfn <dfn> The SAT </dfn> is a standardized test widely used for college admissions in the United States.
        Since its debut in 1926, its name and scoring have changed several times. For much of its history, it was called
        the
        Scholastic Aptitude Test and had two components, Verbal and Mathematical, each of which was scored on a range
        from
        200 to 800. Later it was called the Scholastic Assessment Test, then the SAT I: Reasoning Test, then the SAT
        Reasoning Test, then simply the SAT.</p>
